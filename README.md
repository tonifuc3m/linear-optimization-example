# linear-optimization-example

This project is in a Python 3.7 Jupyter notebook on a Windows environment. 

I have used pyomo to solve the optimization problems. For installing it with Anaconda, please check https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyomo

In addition, inside pyomo I am using the GLPK solver. Please, install it in Anaconda following this instructions: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/glpk

Steps: 

1. An introductory linear optimization problem is proposed.

2. It is implemented in Python and solved. The sensitivities associated with each of the constraints are computed manually. 

3. Then, the dual problem is formulated, implemented and also solved. 

4. Finally, a conditional constraint is also presented and implemented.
